## Description

For this project I was to create a card game app of the casino favorite Blackjack. The app needed to be fully functional in coherence with standard game rules and also have an appealing style. In order to complete the project I needed to utilize HTML, CSS and several other technologies.

- JavaScript. A scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

- React. A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

- React Router. The standard routing library for React. From the docs: “React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy code loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in.

- Immutability-Helper. React lets you use whatever style of data management you want, including mutation. ... However, we've provided a simple immutability helper, update() , that makes dealing with this type of data much easier, without fundamentally changing how your data is represented.
